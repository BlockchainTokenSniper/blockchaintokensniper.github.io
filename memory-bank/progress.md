# Project Progress: BlockchainTokenSniper (BTS) V3 Website

**Note:** This repository and progress report primarily concern the **BTS V3 Website**. Information regarding the BTS V3 bot application's internal workings is handled in separate repositories.

## Current Status (Post Solana Consistency Update 06/11/2025)

*   **Overall:** The BTS V3 Website is under active development. The latest major update was a consistency pass to ensure the new `BlockchainSolanaSniper` is referenced correctly across all relevant pages.
*   **Recent Website Code Changes (Solana Consistency)**:
    *   Updated navigation menus on all pages to include the `BlockchainSolanaSniper` user guide.
    *   Updated `docs/downloads/index.html` to include `BlockchainSolanaSniper` in the list of available bots.
*   **Previous Website Code Changes (Solana Documentation)**:
    *   **`docs/user-guide/SolanaMultiSniper/index.html`**: Created a new, detailed user guide for the Solana bot.
    *   **`index.html`**: Updated to feature the BlockchainSolanaSniper, including adding it to the main list of bots and creating a new descriptive section with a link to the guide.
    *   **`docs/user-guide/user-guides/index.html`**: Updated the table of contents and side navigation to include the new Solana guide.
    *   **`docs/supported-blockchains/index.html`**: Updated to include Solana as a supported network, with details on its integration via the Jupiter API.
*   **Memory Bank Updates (Ongoing)**:
    *   `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` (this file) updated to reflect the consistency changes.

## What Works (Website)

*   All pages now consistently reference the `BlockchainSolanaSniper` bot and its documentation.
*   Navigation links are consistent across the entire website.
*   The homepage correctly introduces all three bot variants.
*   Static assets (CSS, JS for website) are loading correctly.

## What's Left to Build / Refine (High-Level - Website)

**Current Tasks & Next Steps (Website):**
1.  **User Review of Website Consistency**: User to review the website to ensure all references to `BlockchainSolanaSniper` are correct and consistent.
2.  **Add "Project History" Section Template to `index.html`**: This was a pending task from before the Solana update.
3.  If all website changes are approved, await further instructions for website development.

**Next Steps (Bot Application - External Repo, based on previous info):**
*   Continue with comprehensive user testing of the bot's fee system and other core functionalities as previously planned.

## Evolution of Project Decisions (Website)

*   **Product Line Expansion**: The website has been updated to reflect the expansion of the BTS product line to include a non-EVM chain (Solana), requiring new documentation and adjustments to the site's information architecture.
*   **Website Content Strategy**: Iteratively refined website content based on specific user feedback to ensure clarity, accuracy, and inclusion of important information like security advice and migration paths for users of previous versions.
*   **Repository Scope Clarification**: Memory bank and project documentation updated to clearly define this repository as containing only the website code.
