# Project Progress: BlockchainTokenSniper (BTS) V3 Website

**Note:** This repository and progress report primarily concern the **BTS V3 Website**. Information regarding the BTS V3 bot application's internal workings is handled in separate repositories.

## Current Status (Post User Guide Overhaul 07/09/2025)

*   **Overall:** The BTS V3 Website's user documentation has been significantly overhauled. The previously separate user guides have been replaced with a single, comprehensive guide.
*   **Recent Website Code Changes (User Guide Overhaul)**:
    *   **`docs/user-guide/index.html`**: The content of this page was completely replaced with a new, detailed user guide covering all aspects of the bot, including setup, commands, all sniper types, and advanced features.
*   **Memory Bank Updates (Completed 07/09/2025)**:
    *   `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` (this file) updated to reflect the user guide overhaul.

## What Works (Website)

*   The website now features a single, consolidated, and comprehensive user guide at `docs/user-guide/index.html`.
*   This new guide provides up-to-date information on all three sniper bots and their configurations.
*   Navigation links are consistent across the entire website.
*   The homepage correctly introduces all three bot variants.
*   Static assets (CSS, JS for website) are loading correctly.

## What's Left to Build / Refine (High-Level - Website)

**Current Tasks & Next Steps (Website):**
1.  **User Review of New User Guide**: User to review the new comprehensive user guide for accuracy and completeness.
2.  **Cleanup of Old User Guides**: Decide whether to delete or redirect the old, now-redundant user guide files (`docs/user-guide/BlockchainLaunchSniper/`, `docs/user-guide/BlockchainMultiSniper/`, etc.).
3.  **Add "Project History" Section Template to `index.html`**: This was a pending task from before the Solana update.
4.  If all website changes are approved, await further instructions for website development.

**Next Steps (Bot Application - External Repo, based on previous info):**
*   Continue with comprehensive user testing of the bot's fee system and other core functionalities as previously planned.

## Evolution of Project Decisions (Website)

*   **Product Line Expansion**: The website has been updated to reflect the expansion of the BTS product line to include a non-EVM chain (Solana), requiring new documentation and adjustments to the site's information architecture.
*   **Website Content Strategy**: The user guide has been consolidated from multiple separate pages into a single, comprehensive document. This decision was made to improve user experience and simplify content management.
*   **Repository Scope Clarification**: Memory bank and project documentation updated to clearly define this repository as containing only the website code.

*(This document reflects the state after the completion of the user guide overhaul.)*
