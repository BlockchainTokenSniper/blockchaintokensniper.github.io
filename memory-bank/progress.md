# Project Progress: BlockchainTokenSniper (BTS) V3 Website

**Note:** This repository and progress report primarily concern the **BTS V3 Website**. Information regarding the BTS V3 bot application's internal workings is handled in separate repositories.

## Current Status (Post Content and Navigation Correction 16/07/2025)

*   **Overall:** The website's navigation and content have been updated for consistency and accuracy.
*   **Recent Website Code Changes (Content and Navigation Correction)**:
    *   Corrected the security information in `docs/user-guide/index.html` to state that private keys are stored on BTS V3 servers.
    *   Corrected the "SolanaSniper" link to "BlockchainSolanaSniper" in the navigation bar across all relevant pages.
    *   Corrected the navigation bar on all user guide sub-pages (`BlockchainLaunchSniper`, `BlockchainMultiSniper`, `SolanaMultiSniper`) to ensure the dropdown menu appears correctly and consistently across the entire site.
    *   Updated the navigation bar across all other relevant pages (`index.html`, `404.html`, and all pages in `docs/`) to include a consistent dropdown menu for the User Guides.
    *   Removed outdated Jekyll front matter from `docs/user-guide/index.html`.
    *   Removed outdated Telegram API setup instructions from the `BlockchainMultiSniper` and `SolanaMultiSniper` user guides.
*   **Memory Bank Updates (Completed 16/07/2025)**:
    *   `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` (this file) updated to reflect the navigation and content changes.

## What Works (Website)

*   The navigation bar is now consistent across the entire website, featuring a dropdown menu for the user guides with corrected naming.
*   The user guides provide accurate setup and security information.
*   The main user guide page at `docs/user-guide/index.html` serves as a central hub for all guides.
*   The homepage correctly introduces all three bot variants.
*   Static assets (CSS, JS for website) are loading correctly.

## What's Left to Build / Refine (High-Level - Website)

**Current Tasks & Next Steps (Website):**
1.  **User Review of Updated Website**: User to review the updated website for accuracy and consistent navigation.
2.  **Cleanup of Old User Guides**: Decide whether to delete or redirect the old, now-redundant user guide files (`docs/user-guide/BlockchainLaunchSniper/`, etc.).
3.  **Add "Project History" Section Template to `index.html`**: This was a pending task from before the Solana update.
4.  If all website changes are approved, await further instructions for website development.

**Next Steps (Bot Application - External Repo, based on previous info):**
*   Continue with comprehensive user testing of the bot's fee system and other core functionalities as previously planned.

## Evolution of Project Decisions (Website)

*   **Product Line Expansion**: The website has been updated to reflect the expansion of the BTS product line to include a non-EVM chain (Solana), requiring new documentation and adjustments to the site's information architecture.
*   **Website Content Strategy**: The user guide has been consolidated from multiple separate pages into a single, comprehensive document. This decision was made to improve user experience and simplify content management.
*   **Repository Scope Clarification**: Memory bank and project documentation updated to clearly define this repository as containing only the website code.

*(This document reflects the state after the completion of the content and navigation correction.)*
