# Project Progress: BlockchainTokenSniper (BTS) V3 Website

**Note:** This repository and progress report primarily concern the **BTS V3 Website**. Information regarding the BTS V3 bot application's internal workings, development, or specific bug fixes (e.g., `UnableToPopulateNonceError`, `process_fees.js`, test suites) refers to activities in separate, private repositories unless explicitly stated as a website change.

## What Works (Website)

*   All recent website content changes have been implemented as requested.
*   Navigation links and site structure are functional.
*   Static assets (CSS, JS for website) are loading correctly.

## What Works (Bot Application - External Repo, based on previous info)

*   Fee processing system in `modules_main/process_fees.js` is believed to be stable (pending final user confirmation).
*   **Test Cases 1-8 (`tests/test_suite_v3.js`)**: All Launch Sniper tests were reported as passing.

## What's Left to Build / Refine (High-Level - Website)

**Current Tasks & Next Steps (Website):**
1.  **Add "Project History" Section Template to `index.html`**: Per user request.
2.  **User Review of All Website Changes**: User to review all modified website pages (`index.html`, `buy/index.html`, `docs/migration/index.html`, `docs/downloads/index.html`) for accuracy, clarity, and completeness.
3.  If website changes are approved, await further instructions for website development.

**Next Steps (Bot Application - External Repo, based on previous info):**
1.  **User Testing of Fee System (Comprehensive)**: (Ongoing) User to restart the bot and thoroughly test all aspects of fee deduction.
2.  If fee system is confirmed stable, move to next major steps for bot development (e.g., `checkUntilTradable` functionality).
3.  (Other general bot testing steps as previously listed).

---
**Next Major Step (Bot Application - External Repo, After current testing round): Address `checkUntilTradable` Functionality**
*   (As previously documented for the bot application)
---
*Carry-over tasks from previous focus (Bot Application - External Repo, will need re-testing):*
*   (As previously documented for the bot application).

## Known Issues (Bot Application - External Repo, based on previous info)

*   **Fee System (Overall Functionality)**: Multiple fixes and a rewrite have been applied. Awaiting final comprehensive user re-test to confirm stability and correctness of all fee-related operations in the bot application.
*   (Other previous "FIX ATTEMPTED" issues are now part of the overall fee system re-test for the bot application).

## Evolution of Project Decisions (Website)

*   **Website Content Strategy**: Iteratively refined website content based on specific user feedback to ensure clarity, accuracy, and inclusion of important information like security advice and migration paths for users of previous versions.
*   **Repository Scope Clarification**: Memory bank and project documentation updated to clearly define this repository as containing only the website code.

*(This document reflects the state after the ~7:39pm completion of all requested website updates and the clarification of this repository's scope.)*
