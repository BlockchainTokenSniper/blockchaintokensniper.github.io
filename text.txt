BlockchainTokenSniper started as a very basic script I (@BytePhoenix) uploaded to GitHub around 4 years ago, never expecting anything.

To my surprise, it gained a fair bit of interest at which point I started to make a Telegram group for users and develop it further.

I then created BlockchainLaunchSniper and BlockchainMultiSniper originally for the BSC chain then modified it to support other EVM chains.

These two bots surged in popularity, reaching over 2.5k members in the Telegram group.

Unfortunately the hype died, and I later made V2 (an improved version) with little success, and then V3 when I noticed that most other bots
were Telegram-based and that was much easier to use than having to manually install the bot on a desktop. V3 started out as only the Launch sniper 
bot but now it has been re-developed from the ground up and now includes both bots and many more advanced features.
